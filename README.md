prefGP is a Gaussian process based library for inference and prediction from preference and choice data. It is implemented using Jax and PyTorch. 
prefGP implements __ 9 models__ to learn from preference and choice data:

* Model 1: Consistent Preferences.
* Model 2: Just Noticeable Difference 
* Model 3: Probit for Erroneous Preferences
* Model 4: Preferences with Gaussian noise error
* Model 5: Probit  for Erroneous preferences as a classification problem
* Model 6: Thurstonian model for label preferences
* Model 7: Plackett-Luce model for label ordering data
* Model 8: Paired comparison for label preferences
* Model 9: Rational and Pseudo-rational models for choice data
